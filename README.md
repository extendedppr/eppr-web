# Extended Property Price Register

<img src="/assets/screenshot.png" alt="screenshot"/>

A UI that shows historical property listings (over 700k properties) along with a view that matches Property Price Register items with listings (only around 8% of PPR items are matched) so we can see undervalued properties.

Graphs of information also included, more work needed here to add more stats.

Still plenty of data to get, clean and add.

Mapbox used for geocoding, will use something else for badly scoring matches in time since when matches are bad, they're very bad.

## TODO
 * Upload api repo
 * Include rentals / share
 * Upload listing scraper and ppr matching repo
